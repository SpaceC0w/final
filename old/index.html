			<strong> Ideas + Coding </strong>
			<br>
			I came up with ideas for our layout, and how to display all our need content. 
			Filling the space for rationale and my part of the index page. Using hyperlinks to make all website linked and implementing SEO in our pages.
			
			<br>
			<br>
			<h3>Protosite</h3>
			The drop down navigation idea and content for pages. Following our layout.
			Linking all pages with hyperlinks and making sure our page correponds with SEO parameters.

			<h3>LEO</h3>
			<br>
			<h4>Metasite</h4>
			Generated the site map using slickmap on github and filled in my parts in the introduction and rationale sections using the layout coded by Melanie. 
			<br>
			<br>
			<h3>Protosite</h3>
			Coded a simple login feature that matches the design of the overall layout and constructed the quiz sections using the Accordion widget.

			<h3>KATHY</h3>

			<h4>Metasite</h4>
			Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy 
			text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. 
			<br>
			<br>
			<h3>Protosite</h3>
			It has 
			survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was 
			popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop 
			publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

			<h3>MEL</h3>
			<br>
			<h3>Metasite</h3>
			<h4>Design + Coding</h4>
			I created a layout for our Metasite and coded the introduction page (Home page). I designed a logo with the first letters of our names and 
			coded a header with the navigation sections: Home, Prototype, Sitemap and Rationale.
			I also created a 4 column layout because our group includes four partners. To each group partner I added a picture. Under these pictures 
			you can find the description of what each of us did.
			Furthermore I coded a template for the Rationale page with all parts of our work to have all group partners fill in a description
			of different parts of our work. I wrote the text to the Accordion feature, the Design and Illustration.
			
			<br>
			<br>
			<h3>Protosite</h3>
			<h4>Design + Coding</h4>
			After we agreed verbally on some design features I created a mock up as visual basis for our page.
			When we decided to go with that design I coded a first Prototype page to see how the design behaves in html and css.
			I had the idea to use an Accordion feature for the different sections of larger content like the Lecture section so I
			coded the Accordion with javascript first to see if that works and if it is possible to make that in our timeframe. 
			I tried to follow the design of our mock up as much as possible. Please see at the following pictures.
			
		<div >
			<h5>Mock up done in InDesign<h5>
			<img  src="images/mock_up.jpg" alt="mock_up" />
		</div> 
		
		<div >
			<h5>Actual coding of first prototype page<h5>
			<img  src="images/prototype.jpg" alt="mock_up" />
		</div> 
			I coded the horizontal navigation we agreed to use for our prototype site. 
			I also added an illustration related to our course topic and all other design elements like color, font-size etc.we 
			agreed to use. At the end I finalized my work with coding the dropdown menu for all protosites and finished coding the 
			Course Descriptions page of the Contents section.
