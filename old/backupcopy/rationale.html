		<h2>
		  Login
		</h2>
		<p >The new design of the website includes a log in feature in order to protect the lecture materials of Comp 1950. 
		It is reasonable to have some type of features to prevent non-students to have access to the course contents because 
		these contents are not supposed to be viewed by people who did not pay for the materials. The log in requires the 
		students to type in their username and password from the client for verification from the server side. 
		</p>

		<h2>
		  Accordion 
		</h2>
		<p >A good argument for accordion components, as they allow users to see the outline of the content at a glance. 
		For huge content you have to scroll all the way down through a lot different sections just to find your 
		answer. With the accordion feature you can just scroll through the titles with content temporarily hidden, that makes 
		a much better experience. 
		In our case the accordion feature is very useful for the lecture pages and the quiz page. With that feature you can scroll for example
		through the headlines of a lecture and find the topic you are looking for. This feature helps to make the overall look of the page clean and organized.
