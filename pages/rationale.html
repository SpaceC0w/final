		<h2>
		  Login
		</h2>
		<p >The new design of the website includes a log in feature in order to protect the lecture materials of Comp 1950. 
		It is reasonable to have some type of features to prevent non-students to have access to the course contents because 
		these contents are not supposed to be viewed by people who did not pay for the materials. The log in requires the 
		students to type in their username and password from the client for verification from the server side. 
		</p>

		<h2>
		  Accordion 
		</h2>
		<p >A good argument for accordion components, as they allow users to see the outline of the content at a glance. 
		For huge content you have to scroll all the way down through a lot different sections just to find your 
		answer. With the accordion feature you can just scroll through the titles with content temporarily hidden, that makes 
		a much better experience. 
		In our case the accordion feature is very useful for the lecture pages and the quiz page. With that feature you can scroll for example
		through the headlines of a lecture and find the topic you are looking for. This feature helps to make the overall look of the page clean and organized.

		<h2>
		  Navigation 
		</h2>
		<p > As the client and the users of the website would know, the navigation part is essencial and really important when finding the pages that has the content that you are looking for. So we came up on a idea having a verical nav with sub-sections for other areas of the website. We based our choose on <a href="www.bcit.ca" target="_parent"> BCIT </a> website. 
		</p>
		<div >
			<img class="example_5" src="../images/navigation.png" alt="navigation" />
		</div>
		<br>
		
		<h2>
		  Dropdown Menu 
		</h2>
		<p >The dropdown menu was an important idea to organize and make the website more user friendly and effiecient. Following the estetics of <a href="www.bcit.ca" target="_parent"> BCIT </a> website the dropdown is usefull for links that have sub-sections.
		</p>
		<div >
			<img class="example" src="../images/dropdown.png" alt="dropdown" />
		</div>

		<br>
		
		<h2>
		  Quizzes 
		</h2>
		<p >Having a quiz section within the course website can improve the overall learning experience because it enables the users to spend more times on thinking about the questions rather than figuring out the location of downloading and submitting the quiz.  
		</p>
		<div >
			<img class="example" src="../images/accordion.jpg" alt="accordion" />
		</div>
		<br>
		
		<h2>
		  Design 
		</h2>
		<p >We decided to refer to the BCIT.com website regarding the overall design of the page but to make it at the same time different
		from the original one. The colors refer to the BCIT colors with the blue, yellow and grey. Also the fonts with the upper cases and blue 
		headlines refer to the corporate identity of BCIT. Anyway the overall look different because we decided to work with the BCIT colors in
		some parts in a different way than at the original BCIT website.
		With our new website design we followed the primary goals of this project in case of branding and identity reinforcement with following the 
		BCIT corporate identity. We created a brand awareness with the connection to the current look and feel of the BCIT website. 
		Our design is providing the corporate communication and management of internal content.

		<h2>
		  Illustration 
		</h2>
		<p >We added an illustration what refers to the web development topic and what brightens the look and feel of the page and 
		makes it fun to look at. Additionally that illustration shows very simple what you can expect in that course.

		<h2>
		  Search Function 
		</h2>
		<p >The search function is a simple easy feature that is gonna be usefull for students when trying to search for a specific lesson or subject, not having to scroll and go through different pages to find what is looking for.  
		</p>

		<h2>
		  Dynamic learning user interface
		</h2>
		<p >The accordion feature is build to hekp students to ready and focus on the subject and paragraph that they are in the moment. Hiding all other content, avoiding distractions.
